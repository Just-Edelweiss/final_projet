# final_projet
## What is this ?
It's a really simple terminal game RPG like, with a short story create with python.
## Why ?
This is a school group project for the end of the year.
## What are the objectives ?
I'm imaginating a three stage story :
- first an introduction stage with a tutoriel like objective.
- then a interaction stage, in a abandoned house for exemple where you can obtaine items.
- and for the last one, a simple combat stage.
